## Fyyur
Fyyur is an application where musical artists can meet musical venues.

- Artists and venues can visit this site in order to post information about themselves as well as find each other.
- This site lists information about different venues across different cities, as well as different artists that exist.
- From here, you can also discover shows where different artists are playing at different venues.
- On this site, you have a chance to post a venue and list a new venue if that venue hasn't yet been listed, you could do the same thing with artists as well as shows, you can also find artists and venues.
- For a particular artist, you can view information about their genre, contact information, whether or not they are currently seeking talent, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.
- There's also information about artists here who are also seeking performance venues to play at, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.


### Overview
This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thing… real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, you should have a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

- creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
- searching for venues and artists.
- learning more about a specific artist or venue.

We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!

<hr />

- ```app.py``` -- (Missing functionality.) Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.

- Models in ```app.py``` -- (Missing functionality.) Defines the data models that set up the database tables.

- ```config.py``` -- (Missing functionality.) Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.
